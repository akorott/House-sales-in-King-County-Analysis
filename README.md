# House-sales-in-King-County-Analysis

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com and consists of over 20,000 house listings. 
Each listing includes a number of features, such as the date posted, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, etc. 

The analysis is divided into 3 main parts:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Visualization/EDA
3. Predicting prices using a variety of regression algorithms. 

I worked on the analysis using Jupyter Notebooks - Python. Some of the libraries I utilized throughout the analysis include Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and many others.
